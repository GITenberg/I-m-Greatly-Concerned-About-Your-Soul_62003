<h1>&ldquo;I&rsquo;M GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR
SOUL.&rdquo;</h1>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a small village in one of the
Welsh counties, there lived an old Independent minister who was
peculiarly blessed in being settled amongst a people who worked
well with him, and did all in their power to lessen his
labours.&nbsp; They were a prayerful people, and thought no work
too arduous, and no sacrifice too great, which would bring honour
and glory to the Saviour&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; Whilst in this state
of peaceful prosperity, the attention of this little flock was
aroused by hearing of a new tenant, who had come to reside at a
farm, two or three miles from the little village.&nbsp; In due
time he was visited, but much to the astonishment and deep sorrow
of the people, they found him to be very sceptical in his
notions; nay, worse, he was all but an infidel.&nbsp; Great was
their distress when they discovered this; they did all in their
power to try and make him see the truth.&nbsp; Tracts, bibles,
and many other books were sent; letters, and invitations to
attend the chapel, but all of no use, he took no notice, and at
last they almost gave way to despair, for nothing seemed to move
him.</p>
<p>One night, after a public meeting in the little village
chapel, Mr. S&mdash;, one of the members, went into the vestry to
the minister and said, &ldquo;Sir, what must we do for Mr.
R&mdash; to make him see his danger?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more,&rdquo; replied the minister, &ldquo;can
be done; we have done all we can do, and now we must leave it in
the hands of our Heavenly Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. S&mdash; then
went home, but felt that he had not done <i>all</i> he could, and
would therefore try again.&nbsp; He retired to his own room, and
paced up and down the whole night in great agony of mind.&nbsp;
No prayer would escape his lips, but with his hands convulsively
clasped and his head raised to heaven, he inwardly wrestled with
God in prayer for the conversion of his erring brother.&nbsp; The
following morning he saddled his horse and rode off to see Mr.
R&mdash;, who was busy at work in his fields.&nbsp; He
dismounted, and after the usual salutations, stood for a moment
gazing at him without speaking.&nbsp; He knew not how to say that
which he had on his mind&mdash;he felt quite unnerved, the tears
came into his eyes and rolled one after the other down his
cheeks, but no words would come; at last with a desperate effort
he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m greatly concerned about
<i>your soul</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then as if he were ashamed of
shewing his emotion he hastily mounted his horse and rode off
without another word.&nbsp; Mr. R&mdash; stood motionless after
seeing this outburst of feeling, repeating, &ldquo;Greatly
concerned about <i>my soul</i>, greatly concerned about <i>my</i>
soul, then surely it is time I began to be concerned
myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went on with his work, and tried to
forget what he had heard, but the words still kept ringing in his
ears, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m greatly concerned about your
soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went home and occupied himself with books,
and did all in his power to drive off what he considered
disagreeable thoughts; but on they came, faster and faster,
allowing him no peace.&nbsp; All that day and night, that
important sentence was uppermost in his mind, and he lay tossing
on his bed exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! <i>why</i> am <i>I</i> not
concerned about my own soul?&rdquo;&nbsp; As soon as morning
dawned, he rose, and having breakfasted, went to the little
village and called upon the minister.&nbsp; He related what had
passed, <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>and
then said, &ldquo;Oh sir, why am <i>I not</i> concerned about my
soul, and yet others are for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Minister</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because you have never prayed to
be made so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. R&mdash;</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;But will He whom <i>you</i>
call God, answer the prayers of one who has never acknowledged
Him all his life?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Minister</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, if you ask in <i>faith</i>,
and for the sake of <i>His</i> Son Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Seek, and ye <i>shall</i> find, knock, and it <i>shall</i>
be opened unto <i>you</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. R&mdash; then left, but returned again in a few days
saying that he had prayed earnestly to God to awaken him to a
sense of his danger, and he was now anxious to devote himself to
his Saviour.</p>
<p><i>Minister</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you believe in
Christ?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. R&mdash;</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;With all my
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Minister</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you willing to give up
<i>all</i> to Him if He should require it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. R&mdash;</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, <i>all</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Minister</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can you account for this
great difference in your feelings in so abort a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. R&mdash;</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;After I had left you the
other day, I still kept pondering over those words,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m greatly concerned about your soul,&rsquo; but
still did not feel very anxious myself.&nbsp; I was more struck
with the idea of a comparative stranger being so deeply anxious
about what concerned me so little.&nbsp; But I thought of what
you had said, and I began to pray.&nbsp; Suddenly a strange fear
came upon me; I felt I was in danger, and needed some one to
rescue me.&nbsp; I continued almost agonizing in prayer,
&lsquo;Lord, save, or I perish;&rsquo; and as I prayed, He who
stilled the tempest, also stilled the tumult within my heart and
gave me peace.&nbsp; I felt Him to be near unto me, and even as
Jacob did, I wrestled for a blessing.&nbsp; I sought my bible,
and then the whole plan of salvation became clear unto me, and
<i>now</i> I want to begin to serve my Maker with all my
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time passed on, and each day that once sceptical man grew in
grace, and in the knowledge of his Saviour; he became an earnest
disciple, and went about telling to the world around what a dear
Saviour <i>he</i> had found.</p>
<p>There we see an instance of how much good we may be the means
of doing, if we will only try.&nbsp; <i>Seven</i> words were the
means of arousing that man.&nbsp; The most lengthy and eloquent
discourse will often fail, but a few words spoken in love and
with earnest prayer for their success, may pierce the hardest
heart.</p>
<p>Unconverted reader!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m greatly concerned about
<i>your soul</i>.&nbsp; <i>How</i> do you intend to answer the
questions put to you at the last day?&nbsp; How will you dare to
say, I <i>knew</i> the way, but I <i>would not</i> walk in
it?&nbsp; Do you ever think of the future? do you remember that
there <i>must be</i> an end to your life, and that you
<i>must</i> live again either in happiness or misery?&nbsp; Oh!
stop and think; ere you leap the fatal precipice, pray for mercy!
and remember that you <i>may</i> live without Christ, but
<i>how</i> will you <i>die</i> without Him?</p>
<p>Let me tell you again &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>greatly</i>
concerned about <i>your soul</i>,&rdquo; and earnestly pray that
our Heavenly Father will, ere it is too late, make you concerned
about your own soul.</p>

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
